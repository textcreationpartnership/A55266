            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS Mariners, that in a Storm are Tost,</l>
               <l>If they can get in safety to the Shore,</l>
               <l>Ne'r mind the Toyl and Pains it Cost;</l>
               <l>But set it all on Safeties Score:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So, <hi>Loyal Sir!</hi> though you have been of Late,</l>
               <l>Perplexed with a <hi>Damn'd Rebellious Crew;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That strive to over-throw <hi>King, Church,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Remember, therefore, what to <hi>Both</hi> is Due.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let not the <hi>Laws, Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of <hi>Caesar</hi> lye within the Power of those,</l>
               <l>Whom you may see, by their <hi>Rebellious Strife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Have Sworn themselves the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> Foes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why do they Quarrel else, without Occasion,</l>
               <l>And fill the Rabble with such causeless Fears;</l>
               <l>What mean they by their <hi>Damn'd Association,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But for to set's together by the Ears?</l>

               </l>
               <l>Of <hi>Subjects Rights,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> too;</l>
               <l>Where was our <hi>Priviledge</hi> in that sad Hour,</l>
               <l>When these curst <hi>Rebells</hi> did the Land subdue?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> was no Crimes,</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> was not nam'd;</l>
               <l>Though all that knew or hear'd of those <hi>sad Times,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Must doubtless think those very <hi>Saints</hi> were Damn'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Was not Our <hi>Martyr'd Sov'raigne, Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Strip't of their Rights, Prerogative, and Power?</l>
               <l>Did <hi>He</hi> not fall a <hi>Victim</hi> to their Hate,</l>
               <l>That would again <hi>King, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> devour?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If <hi>Murders, Treasons,</hi> and such Crimes go free,</l>
               <l>As they have done of Late, with great Applause;</l>
               <l>What need they care, how wicked then they be,</l>
               <l>So they can carry on the <hi>Good Old Cause?</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Go on therefore, and put the Laws in Force,</l>
               <l>If you'd besafe; there's nothing else will do:</l>
               <l>And let not <hi>Ignoramus</hi> stop their Course,</l>
               <l>To favour any of the <hi>Factions Crew.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then would our <hi>Isle</hi> enjoy a Happy State,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Caesar</hi> Reign in Safety on the <hi>Throne;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By your Example, would His Friends increase</l>
               <l>And all obediently His Power own?</l>
